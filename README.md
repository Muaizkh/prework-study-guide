# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
A study guide for course pre-work reagarding the UofT full stack Coding bootcamp

The motivation for creating this was to understand and begin my journey in learning coding. I was able to get experience that was much needed and it further helped with any anxiety I was feeling regarding the bootcamp. I have much to learn but this was a good starting point.

## Installation
You do not have to install anything to read look at my project besides a web browser. However, to create this you would need Visual Studio Code, Chrome and extensions along with the use of the built in terminal

## Usage
This webpage can be used to help understand the basics of HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. With some notes taken while completing the bootcamp prework. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.

## Collaborators
